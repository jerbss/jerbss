## Back-End Developer

🎓 I'm currently pursuing a degree in **Digital Systems and Media** at the Federal University of Ceará (UFC).

🚀 **Why Back-End Development?** I fell in love with technology because it lets me solve complex problems, build robust systems, and create magic behind the scenes. Every project is an adventure filled with opportunities to learn, create, and make a difference.

### 🔥 What I'm Working On Now

I'm currently part of an exciting academic project called **Synes - CadêURacha** 🏀, a system for mapping and organizing public basketball courts.  

As the back-end developer, I use Django to implement core functionalities. Recently, I migrated the project to PostgreSQL and deployed it on Railway, expanding its capabilities and scalability. This hands-on experience has been both challenging and rewarding!
